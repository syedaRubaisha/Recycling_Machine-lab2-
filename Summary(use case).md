The Recycling Machine Application use case diagram shows how customers and operators interact with the system.
Customers can start a return session, deposit bottles or cans, request receipts, and receive refunds. The system automatically recognizes each item type, records transactions, and calculates refund amounts.

Operators manage the system by viewing daily summaries, generating reports, updating deposit values, and handling machine issues. When a problem occurs—like a jammed can or empty receipt roll—the system triggers an alarm for the operator to resolve.

Overall, the diagram highlights the system’s key functions: item recognition, transaction recording, receipt generation, report creation, and error handling, ensuring smooth and efficient recycling operations for both customers and operators.
